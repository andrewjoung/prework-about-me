      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am 23 years young and excited to embark on this journey towards being a web and software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Bellevue, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love listening to music, attending concerts, golfing, snowboarding, hiking, and almost anything that allows me to be outdoors.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to work at Spotify which is an application and service that I love and that I use on a daily basis. However,
        in the future I hope to one day be a project manager and use my outgoing personality and leadership skills to create, motivate, and inspire a 
        collective of like-minded individuals. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Bellevue. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to become a web developer because it is something I have had exposure to and immediately became attached to.
        Its a topic that came easily to me and is a field that takes both coding, imagination, and design thinking to bring elegant UX/UI into the world.
